This repository contains the code, figures, and tutorial materials for “Understanding LSTMs: How Long Short-Term Memory Networks Overcome the Vanishing Gradient Problem.” The project explains why standard RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies and how LSTMs solve this through gated memory mechanisms. Using the IMDB movie review dataset, the notebook demonstrates text preprocessing, sequence analysis, and visualisations including sentiment distribution, review-length histograms, and boxplots. All plots use a consistent professional blue colour palette. The repository includes the tutorial report, dataset (if permitted), generated figures, and a Jupyter notebook with reproducible code for learners studying sequential modelling.
